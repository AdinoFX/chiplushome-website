Dynamic Property Listings: All properties are loaded from a central JavaScript "database" file, making updates easy.

Advanced Search & Filtering: Users can filter properties in real-time by type, location, and price range.

Detailed Property Pages: Each property has its own dedicated page with a photo gallery, detailed descriptions, and key information.

Direct WhatsApp Lead Generation: A "Book Inspection" button on each property page opens WhatsApp with a pre-filled, customized message for instant lead capture.

Full Blog System: A complete blog with a main listing page and individual article pages to build brand authority.

Social Sharing: Users can easily share blog posts on major social media platforms.

Professional UX/UI Features: Includes client testimonials, a partner logo carousel, "lazy loading" for images, skeleton loading animations, and a "back-to-top" button.

SEO & Social Meta Tags: Dynamic meta tags are generated for property and blog pages, ensuring professional link previews when shared on social media.

Fully Responsive: Designed and tested to work beautifully on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
