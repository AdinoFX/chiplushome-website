            <p>Land banking is the practice of buying large blocks of undeveloped land with the intention of holding it for future use or sale. In a rapidly urbanizing country like Nigeria, this strategy has proven to be highly profitable. The key is to identify areas with high growth potential, often on the outskirts of major cities.</p>
            <p>By purchasing land before development reaches the area, you can acquire it at a low cost and sell it for a significant profit as the city expands. It is a long-term investment that requires patience but offers a high degree of security and substantial returns.</p>
